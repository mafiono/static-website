class="page-cms__title">GENERAL RULES<small>Effective from: 21/04/21</small><small>Last updated: 28/06/21</small></div><div class="page-cms__content"><p>These terms and conditions apply when using the Sportsbook platform for betting. When placing a bet, the account owner automatically accepts the terms of the Sportsbook and fully agrees with them.</p><p>Sportsbook reserves the right, without prior personal notice, to make any changes or additions to the rules, regulations and payment procedures set forth herein, as well as to payment and betting limits. Therewith, the conditions of previously made bets remain unchanged, and all subsequent bets are subject to the changed rules.</p><p>By accepting the terms and registering on the website, you agree that Sportsbook has a right to conduct any identification, credit and other verification checks from time to time as necessary and in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations or as requested by the relevant regulatory authorities. You agree to provide the requested information in connection with these verification checks. We reserve the right to suspend your account or restrict your access to it in any reasonable way until the appropriate checks are completed to our satisfaction.</p><p>We make every effort to ensure that the website content is correct but all information about the current progress of events is for informational purposes only. Sportsbook does not accept any responsibility for inaccuracies. We recommend that you always use alternative sources of information.</p><p>If some issue is not subject to these rules, Sportsbook reserves its right to finalize the decision individually and based on the principles of fairness.</p><p>Sportsbook is the final authority responsible for the validity of any accepted tickets, regardless of the conditions in which those tickets were made.</p><p>Pre-match tickets may be accepted before the specified time and this time may not relate to the commencement of the event in question. Sportsbook reserves its right to invalidate tickets placed after the specified time, including due to content sync errors or amended start times. If for whatever reason a ticket is accepted following the commencement of the event, it means that the rules of the game have been violated, therefore Sportsbook reserves its right to cancel such tickets and calculate the odds at 1.</p><p>The home team is displayed first and the guest team is displayed second, unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Sportsbook reserves its right to modify offered betting odds (rates) at any time and to suspend or cancel event betting prior to the arranged start time.</p><p>Sportsbook reserves its right to refuse tickets without notice, compensation or justification. Sportsbook is not responsible for errors during entering, transferring, displaying or posting information about bets or odds. If any ticket bet before the event start time is accepted as a result of an error, Sportsbook reserves its right to invalidate it if there were clear errors regarding odds or results, such as the erroneous display of odds, participating teams, results, etc.</p><p>Sportsbook reserves its right to hold the provision of odds throughout an event due to a failed broadcast or other technical issues or suspected fraud. Sportsbook reserves its right to invalidate the tickets if such tickets were won as a result of an error or technical failure, including, but not limited to, data transmission errors. In any such event, tickets are void. In addition, Sportsbook reserves its right to make the customer accountable for any harm caused to us, whether directly or indirectly, as a result of the customer knowingly benefiting from a technical/organizational error when receiving or making payments.</p><p>Unless otherwise specified in the specialized rules for a particular sport, then:</p><p>Any event, match or competition that is discontinued, canceled or anything else before the end of full time (as specified by the rules, such as 80 minutes for rugby games and 90 for games of football) are voided.</p><p>Any event, match or competition that is postponed or canceled will be void.</p><p>Outright bets will lose if the selected player or team does not participate. Draw rules also apply. Unless otherwise specified, whenever the organizational body deems it appropriate to include additional matches, match series, or rounds (e.g. playoffs, playouts, postseason) after the end of the regular season, a process often utilized to determine the classifications and additional outcomes, Sportsbook will consider the outcomes of these matches when calculating tickets for the final classification, raising, lowering, etc. As an example, all regular season bets on the NHL winners are relative to the winners of the Stanley Cup. All tickets will be calculated based on the awards ceremony or the official competition protocol, without considering the results of any investigations, disqualifications, and other procedural outcomes.</p><p>One such contingency is when a wager in a multiple bet affects another. For instance, a double in which Roger Federer wins the Wimbledon semi-finals and also wins the Wimbledon title.</p><p>Sportsbook reserves its right to decide which bets involve contingency.</p><p>Sportsbook does not accept multiple tickets that are related to contingencies and it retains the right to invalidate, at its discretion, any and all multiple tickets wagered on a related contingency. Combinations containing the related contingencies will be nullified and cannot be placed on multi bets. In cases when a ticket containing a related contingency is mistakenly accepted, Sportsbook will void the placed multiple ticket and refund the ticket bet.</p><p>In certain cases, Sportsbook will provide customers with combination bets to wager on, for example: Harry Kane to be the top scorer in the World Cup, and England to lift the trophy.</p><p>If two participants of the competition are declared winners (draw), the number of paid places that were picked by the winners will be apportioned between the total number of players. Then the odds of selection are multiplied by that number. For example: in a competition where there are 5 paid places, two are established and the others tie for the following place. Since there are only three places left, the odds will be multiplied accordingly and place winnings will be paid.</p><p>If a market with two competitors results in a tie or the correct number of claimed goals, points or runs, and no market is offered for that outcome, the result is a Push. In such situations, bets are returned for single bets, and for multi-tickets, the selection is classed as not participating, and the ticket is calculated based on the remaining outcomes.</p><p>Unless otherwise specified in the specific rules for a specific sport, then:</p><p>At the very least, one competitor needs to finish the competition, otherwise, all tickets will be considered void.</p><p>When one or multiple competitors do not start, tickets are void.</p><p>If all of the competitors are excluded, as is the case with disqualification, all tickets will be considered void.</p><p>If both or all competitors have the same score or result, and no odds of a draw are offered, all tickets will be void. In situations where there are 3 competitors (as in golf), when 2 or more competitors have the same result, we cancel the winning and send "Outcome = C" with a message: for example, "Dead Heat: Winner cannot be determined, Results: 70 : 70: 74".</p><p>Unless otherwise specified, the total zero score is considered an even number.</p><p>If the original multi-ticket includes a mistaken competitor or invalid selection, the ticket will be calculated based on the selections that remain. The odds for an invalid bet selection will be 1.</p><h3>Bets</h3><p>A bet is considered valid from the moment of its registration in accordance with the conditions determined by these rules. After the bettor clicks on "Place a bet" in the bet coupon and a window appears with the message "Bet accepted", the bet is considered made. If this message does not appear, the customer should check their betting history or contact support for clarification.</p><p>If the odds change at the time the bet is placed, the player will receive a notification in the bet coupon. The bet may not be accepted by the system until the player agrees to the changed odds. The player can turn on the option "Accept odds change" so that the bet is accepted immediately without confirmation of the changed odds.</p><p>Sportsbook reserves its right to invalidate a bet and invalidate it in the following situations:</p><p>there is evidence of unfair contest.</p><p>there was a technical error leading to erroneous information being displayed during the selection of game outcomes.</p><p>if the player violates the terms of the bet. The decision to declare a game outcome void is at the discretion of the Sportsbook administration.</p><p>The player has no option to cancel the registered outcome after placing the bet. The player is obliged to ensure the selected outcome corresponds to their wish before confirming payment for participation in the bet.</p><p>The maximum bet amount depends on various criteria: sports, event, market, etc. These factors are determined by our platform for each event and for each type of bet and are subject to change without prior written notice. Sportsbook reserves its right to limit bets on individual events and to impose or remove special account limits for individual customers without notice or explanation.</p><p>Sportsbook reserves its right to restrict or deny betting to any person without giving any reason or prior notice.</p><p>Client has no right to bet on the events of which he is a participant (athlete, coach, referee, etc.), and also if he acts on behalf of these persons.</p><p>Sportsbook announces results based on the official scoresheet and other additional sources of information after the event is finished. Following disputable situations, discrepancies in the results posted by various sources, obvious errors made by them, the final decision on determining the results for the calculation of bets is taken by Sportsbook.</p><p>If there is a reason to believe that the bet was placed after the outcome of the event was already known, or after the competitor gained an advantage (for example, an advantage in the score, replacement or removal of a player, etc.), Sportsbook reserves its right to invalidate the given bet (make a return), on both winning and losing outcomes.</p><p>During the calculation of bets in live events, Sportsbook uses its own data on the actual progress of the game. If the results of events cannot be established for some reason, these events will be calculated with odds of 1.</p><p>Sportsbook is not responsible for the accurate translation of the names of the competitors, teams and cities where the events on the outcome of which the bet is made will take place.</p><p>It is prohibited to include in "express" and "system" the different events of the same match, bets on the same player in the same tournament (for example, on winning a tournament and on winning a match). If any events related to this match were included in the "express" or "system", this bet will be refunded even if the betting platform has not blocked it.</p><p>Sportsbook prohibits group bets. Repeated bets on the same outcomes from the same or different clients may subsequently be declared void. After the official result of a competition/event is known, Sportsbook may decide to void such bets if it suspects that customers are acting in collusion.</p><p>The final basis for calculating the bet is the official source. The winning amount is determined by multiplying the bet amount by the odds offered at the time of placing the bets.</p><p>All bet refunds will be credited to the bettor's account.</p><p>All claims and disputes on rates will not be accepted after 7 days from the date of calculation of such rates.</p><h3>Special Rules</h3><h3>Basic Terms and Definitions</h3><p>Line - A list of suggested events with odds of potential winnings provided by Sportsbook.
