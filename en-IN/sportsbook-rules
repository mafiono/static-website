class="cms-page__title">Sportsbook Rules</h2><p class="cms-page__reneval">Last Update: 22.10.2021</p><p>1.1. These terms and conditions apply when using the Sportsbook platform for betting. When placing a bet, the account owner automatically accepts the terms of the Sportsbook and fully agrees with them.</p><p>1.2. Sportsbook reserves the right, without prior personal notice, to make any changes or additions to the rules, regulations and payment procedures set forth herein, as well as to payment and betting limits. Therewith, the conditions of previously made bets remain unchanged, and all subsequent bets are subject to the changed rules.</p><p>1.3. By accepting the terms and registering on the website, you agree that Sportsbook has a right to conduct any identification, credit and other verification (video verification) checks from time to time as necessary and in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations or as requested by the relevant regulatory authorities. You agree to provide the requested information in connection with these verification checks. We reserve the right to suspend your account or restrict your access to it in any reasonable way until the appropriate checks are completed to our satisfaction.</p><p>1.4.We reserve the right to make a phone call to the number provided in your user account, which at our own discretion can be a necessary part of the KYC procedure. Until the account is fully verified, no cashouts will be processed. In case the provided phone number is incorrect, missing or false or the player will not answer the phone call, we reserve the right to confiscate your winnings and/or disable your user account. We will make reasonable efforts trying to contact you regarding the withdrawal of the funds, but if we are not able to reach you (by email or phone) in two (2) weeks, the funds will be retained by the Company, since you have failed to pass the KYC procedure.</p><p>1.5. We make every effort to ensure that the website content is correct but all information about the current progress of events is for informational purposes only. Sportsbook does not accept any responsibility for inaccuracies. We recommend that you always use alternative sources of information.</p><p>1.6. If some issue is not subject to these rules, Sportsbook reserves its right to finalize the decision individually and based on the principles of fairness.</p><p>1.7. Sportsbook is the final authority responsible for the validity of any accepted tickets, regardless of the conditions in which those tickets were made.</p><p>1.8. Pre-match tickets may be accepted before the specified time and this time may not relate to the commencement of the event in question. Sportsbook reserves its right to invalidate tickets placed after the specified time, including due to content sync errors or amended start times.</p><p>If for whatever reason a ticket is accepted following the commencement of the event, it means that the rules of the game have been violated, therefore Sportsbook reserves its right to cancel such tickets and calculate the odds at 1.</p><p>1.9. The home team is displayed first and the guest team is displayed second, unless otherwise specified.</p><p>1.10. Sportsbook reserves its right to modify offered betting odds (rates) at any time and to suspend or cancel event betting prior to the arranged start time.</p><p>1.11. Sportsbook reserves its right to refuse tickets without notice, compensation or justification.</p><p>Sportsbook is not responsible for errors during entering, transferring, displaying or posting information about bets or odds. If any ticket bet before the event start time is accepted as a result of an error, Sportsbook reserves its right to invalidate it if there were clear errors regarding odds or results, such as the erroneous display of odds, participating teams, results, etc.</p><p>In the case of an incorrect settlement of markets, we reserve the right to correct them anytime.</p><p>1.12. Sportsbook reserves its right to hold the provision of odds throughout an event due to a failed broadcast or other technical issues or suspected fraud. Sportsbook reserves its right to invalidate the tickets if such tickets were won as a result of an error or technical failure, including, but not limited to, data transmission errors. In any such event, tickets are void. In addition, Sportsbook reserves its right to make the customer accountable for any harm caused to us, whether directly or indirectly, as a result of the customer knowingly benefiting from a technical/organizational error when receiving or making payments.</p><p>1.13. Unless otherwise specified in the specialized rules for a particular sport, then:</p><ul><li>   Any event, match or competition that is discontinued, canceled or anything else before the end of full time (as specified by the rules, such as 80 minutes for rugby games and 90 for games of football) are voided.</li><li>   Any event, match or competition that is postponed or canceled will be void.</li><li>   If the rules or format of a match differ from our accepted norm, we reserve the right to void any market.</li></ul><p>1.14.Outright markets are considered All In Run Or Not and therefore will be settled as a loss if the selection does not take part in the event. Dead Heat rules apply.</p><p>Unless otherwise specified, whenever the organizational body deems it appropriate to include additional matches, match series, or rounds (e.g. playoffs, playouts, postseason) after the end of the regular season, a process often utilized to determine the classifications and additional outcomes, Sportsbook will consider the outcomes of these matches when calculating tickets for the final classification, raising, lowering, etc.</p><p><em>As an example, all regular season bets on the NHL winners are relative to the winners of the Stanley Cup.</em></p><p><em>All tickets will be calculated based on the awards ceremony or the official competition protocol, without considering the results of any investigations, disqualifications, and other procedural outcomes</em>.</p><p>1.15.A related contingency is a multiple bet where the outcome of one selection can contribute to the outcome of another selection, e.g. a double containing Andre Agassi to win his US Open Semi-Final combined with Andre Agassi to win the US Open Outright.</p><ul><li>   <strong>Sportsbook reserves its right to decide which bets involve contingency</strong>.</li><li>   Sportsbook does not accept multiple tickets that are related to contingencies and it retains the right to invalidate, at its discretion, any and all multiple tickets wagered on a related contingency.</li><li>   Combinations containing the related contingencies will be nullified and cannot be placed on multi bets. In cases when a ticket containing a related contingency is mistakenly accepted, Sportsbook will void the placed multiple ticket and refund the ticket bet.</li></ul><p><em>In certain instances, Sportsbook will make available combinations of related contingencies for customers to place bets on, e.g. Harry Kane to be World Cup Top Goalscorer and</em><em></em><em>England to win the World Cup Outright.</em></p><p>1.16.In the event of at least two competitors being declared the winner (<strong>a</strong><strong>Dead Heat</strong>), the number of paying places remaining after clear winners are settled is divided by the number of players sharing those places. The odds for the selection are then multiplied by this number.</p><p><em>e.g. In a competition with 5 paying places the top two players are settled while four players share third place. Since there are only three remaining paying places for these four players, the place odds for each player are multiplied by 0.75.</em></p><p>1.17.In the event of a two competitor market resulting in a draw, a tie or exactly the number of quoted goals, points or runs and no price is offered for this conclusion the outcome is<strong>a Push</strong>. In this situation the resolution of single bets is to return stakes and for multiple tickets the selection is considered a non-runner and the ticket will be settled on the outstanding selections.</p><p>1.18.Unless otherwise stated in the Special Rules for the specific sport:</p><ul><li>   At least one competitor must finish the event or all tickets are considered void.</li><li>   If one or more competitor(s) fail to start all tickets are considered void.</li><li>   If all competitors are disqualified or otherwise excluded all tickets are considered void.</li><li>   If both competitors in a head to head achieve the same result and no draw odds are offered then all tickets are considered void In cases with 3 competitors (Golf 3balls), where 2 competitors or more achieve the same result then win we cancel and send: "Outcome=C" with a hint: e.g. "Dead Heat: No winner can be decided, Results: 70:70:74"</li></ul><p>1.19.1.Unless otherwise stated, total counts of zero will be settled as Even.</p><p>1.19.2. If the original multi-ticket includes a mistaken competitor or invalid selection, the ticket will be calculated based on the selections that remain. The odds for an invalid bet selection will be 1.</p><p>1.19.3. The following cryptocurrencies are supported for placing bets: Bitcoin, Dash, Etherium, Litecoin, Millitbitcoin, Monero.</p><h2><strong>Basic Terms and Definitions</strong></h2><p>1.20.1.<strong>Line</strong>- A list of suggested events with odds of potential winnings provided by Sportsbook.</p><p>1.20.2.<strong>Player (client)</strong>is an individual who has made a bet with the Sportsbook.</p><p>1.20.3.<strong>A bet</strong>is an agreement entered into by a customer with a Sportsbook, according to the terms of which the loser must fulfill his obligations.
